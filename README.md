This program takes every text that has been sent from any person, stores them into a csv file, and then parses through the texts and performs a sentiment analysis.  

You can find the average amount of negative, postive, or neutral texts you recieved from any given person at any given time. More so, you can find out best of the best texts as well as the worst of the worst texts from any given person. Lastly, you can graph a moving average of positive vs. negative texts on any desired timeframe. Enjoy!
